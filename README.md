## Number Guessing Game in Java
* Introduction
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This Java console application provides an engaging experience where players can guess a randomly generated number within a predefined range. The game includes features such as hints, timing records, scoring, and a give-up option for revealing the answer.
## Features
* Hints
After each guess, the game provides helpful hints to guide players towards the correct answer. If the guess is too high, the game will suggest "Lower," and if the guess is too low, the hint will be "Higher."

* Timing Records
The game records the time it takes for players to successfully guess the correct number. This adds a competitive element and encourages players to improve their time with each attempt.

* Scoring
Players earn a score based on the time taken to guess the number. The faster the correct guess, the higher the score. A scoring algorithm is in place to calculate and display the player's score at the end of each game.

* Give Up Option
If a player is stuck or wants to end the game prematurely, they can use the "give up" option. This option reveals the correct answer and concludes the game, providing an opportunity for players to learn and improve.
